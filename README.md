# ElectroPY

ElectroPy allows for the conversion of [VERITAS](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/) data to a [DL3](https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3/)-like data format. 

Intermediate stage files can be easily coverted to dataframes and arrays for easy use with standard ML libraries such as [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
